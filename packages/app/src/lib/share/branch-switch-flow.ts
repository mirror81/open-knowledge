/**
 * Pure helpers for the share-receive branch-switch dialog variant.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   - `BranchInfoResponse` from `GET /api/git/branch-info` — the receiver's
 *     current branch, whether the shared file exists at that ref, and the
 *     subset of dirty working-tree files that would conflict with a switch
 *     to the share's branch.
 *   - `CheckoutResponse` from `POST /api/git/checkout` — outcome of the
 *     server-side checkout call once the user clicks "Switch".
 *   - `WorktreeCreateResult` from the desktop bridge's `worktree.checkout` —
 *     outcome of the share-scoped worktree create-or-locate once the user
 *     clicks "Open in worktree".
 *
 * The state-matrix logic lives here so it's testable without mounting a
 * React tree. The dialog component renders the variant returned by
 * `selectBranchSwitchVariant` and dispatches on the action returned by
 * `classifyCheckoutOutcome`.
 *
 * The dialog MUST NOT navigate when checkout returns `{ok: true}` — navigation
 * waits on the CC1 `branch-switched` signal so the CRDT transition is fully
 * settled before the doc opens. `classifyCheckoutOutcome` returns
 * `'await-cc1'` for this case; the dialog then waits on that signal before
 * opening the doc.
 *
 * That CC1 gate covers the switch leg only — it exists because a same-window
 * checkout recycles the CRDT session under the open doc. The worktree leg
 * (`markCreatingWorktree` / `applyWorktreeCheckoutOutcome`) opens the share
 * branch in its OWN window and never touches the anchor window's checkout, so
 * on success it opens directly with no CC1 wait, like the pivot leg.
