/**
 * Which launchable CLIs are on PATH, from the desktop probe (cached ~60s in
 * main). Shared by every launch entry point — the header / tab-strip "New chat",
 * the "Ask X" bubble, and the Open-with-AI menus — so they resolve and gate the
 * same installed set.
 *
 * Starts empty (unknown, not "none installed") until the async probe resolves.
 * A partial/older bridge, the web host with no `terminal` surface, or a probe
 * failure leaves keys `undefined` (unknown). Consumers must NOT read unknown as
 * "absent": `resolveDefaultCli` treats it optimistically, and `isTerminalCliEnabled`
 * fails open (an unknown CLI still renders), so a probe miss never silently drops
 * an installed CLI from the launch surfaces for the whole session.
 *
 * Re-probes when the window regains focus so a CLI installed mid-session (the
 * user left to a terminal/installer and came back) appears without an app
 * restart, and a transient probe failure or a cold empty map self-heals. The
 * main-process 60s cache keeps repeat focus events cheap.
