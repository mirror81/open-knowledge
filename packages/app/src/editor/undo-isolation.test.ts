/**
 * The exception-safety property of `dispatchAsOwnUndoStep`: the CLOSING
 * `stopCapturing()` must run even when `view.dispatch` throws — a
 * split-open-but-never-closed capture merges the user's next keystrokes into
 * the failed item, and one undo then strips them together. The happy path is
 * covered by the collab-rig undo suites in gfm-autolink-plugin.test.ts and
 * inline-link-input-rule.test.ts; this file pins the throw path (the only
 * path where the `finally` matters — a try/catch refactor would break it).
