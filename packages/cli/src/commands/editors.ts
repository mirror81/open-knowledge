/**
 * Resilient chain (v2) — the Unix member of the two-shape canonical set
 * (Windows sibling: `CHAIN_WIN_V1`). One byte-identical entry every
 * macOS/Linux developer's editor sees.
 *
 * At MCP-host spawn time, `/bin/sh -l -c CHAIN_V2` resolves whichever runtime
 * is locally available — bundle first, then `npx` on a login-shell PATH, then
 * an explicit glob across the common version-manager directories. Desktop-only
 * users (no Node) hit a bundle branch; npm-installed CLI users hit `npx`;
 * teammates with neither see the structured stderr and exit 127.
 *
 * Three bundle probes — macOS user-local first (`$HOME/Applications`), then
 * the macOS system path (`/Applications`), then the Linux deb layout
 * (`/opt/OpenKnowledge`). The mac ordering matches `findBundledOkPath` in
 * `packages/cli/src/mcp/bundle-proxy.ts`, which already treats the user-local
 * install as first-class for users on locked-down macs or non-admin macOS
 * accounts. Diverging here would silently drop the bundle branch for the
 * exact DMG persona it exists to serve. The deb probe (v2) keeps a deb-only
 * Linux user off the npx/registry path — without it their MCP entry either
 * runs a version-drifting `@latest` or, with no Node installed, dies with
 * "install OK Desktop" while OK Desktop is installed (VM-verified). AppImage
 * installs have no stable path and decline MCP wiring entirely, so no
 * AppImage probe exists.
 *
 * Each branch is empirically load-bearing:
 *   1. `[ -f ] && [ -x ]` BEFORE every `exec`. `exec MISSING_FILE` in a
 *      non-interactive `sh -c` aborts the shell with 126 before `||` can
 *      fire — `exec a || exec b` is broken. `[ -f ]` also filters
 *      directories (which `[ -x ]` alone treats as executable).
 *   2. `/bin/sh` not `$SHELL` and not `/bin/zsh`. zsh errors on unmatched
 *      globs (`zsh: no matches found`); POSIX sh leaves the literal and
 *      `[ -f ]` rejects it. Also keeps the config bytes identical across
 *      developer machines (no `$SHELL` substitution at write time).
 *   3. `-l` login flag. macOS `/bin/sh -l` sources `/etc/profile`, which
 *      runs `path_helper` — populates PATH with brew/installer Node
 *      locations without baking the user's shell.
 *   4. Explicit glob probe for nvm/fnm/asdf/mise/volta/local — those
 *      version managers typically wire PATH from `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`,
 *      which `/bin/sh -l` does NOT source.
 *   5. `exec` propagates signals + exit codes. Replaces the shell so
 *      SIGTERM from the MCP host reaches the bundle/npx directly.
 *   6. Bundle runtime crashes propagate; no npx fallback after `exec
 *      "$BUNDLE"` succeeds. Silently retrying via npx would hide install
 *      corruption.
 *   7. `@latest` on the package spec is load-bearing: without it,
 *      `npa('@inkeep/open-knowledge')` parses as `type: 'range', spec: '*'`,
 *      which routes through `npm-pick-manifest`'s engine-aware sort. Users
 *      on a Node version older than the package's `engines.node` get
 *      silently downgraded to the highest engine-compatible version (often
 *      years-stale), with no warning. The `@latest` tag bypasses that
 *      filter and either returns the published latest or surfaces a loud
 *      `EBADENGINE`. `-y` suppresses the install-confirm prompt under
 *      non-TTY (MCP hosts are always non-TTY).
 *
 * The first line `# ok-mcp-v2` is both a shell comment and the version
 * sentinel checked by `isEntryUpToDate`. Bump the suffix (`v3`, `v4`, …)
 * on any structurally-different chain so reclaim recognizes stale text —
 * v1 → v2 added the deb probe, so v1 entries now classify stale and the
 * repair sweep upgrades them in place (inert on macOS: the deb path never
 * exists there).
 *
 * `CHAIN_V2` / `CHAIN_VERSION_SENTINEL` are package-internal — exported
 * from this module for per-package tests, but DELIBERATELY NOT re-exported
 * from `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. Cross-package consumers should use
 * `buildManagedServerEntry()` to construct chain-shape entries and
 * `isEntryUpToDate()` to classify them — bytes are an implementation detail.

/**
 * Resilient chain (win v1) — the Windows member of the two-shape canonical
 * set. `powershell -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command CHAIN_WIN_V1` resolves
 * a runtime at MCP-host spawn time: the npm-global `ok.cmd` shim first, then
 * `npx.cmd` from PATH, then explicit version-manager/installer dirs. No
 * bundle branches — OK Desktop does not ship on Windows, so `npm i -g
 * @inkeep/open-knowledge` is the primary install persona. That is also why
 * the pinned global shim outranks `npx @latest`: the MCP server and the `ok`
 * CLI the user runs by hand must resolve to the SAME installed version
 * (`@latest`-first would let them silently diverge).
 *
 * Each detail is empirically load-bearing:
 *   1. `powershell` (Windows PowerShell 5.1), not `cmd` and not `pwsh`.
 *      PowerShell 5.1 is preinstalled on every Windows box; PowerShell 7 is
 *      not. A `cmd /c` one-liner cannot carry this chain safely — cmd's
 *      quote/paren parsing does not follow the argument-quoting rules MCP
 *      hosts emit, and `rem` swallows the rest of its line, so the version
 *      sentinel could not survive as a comment.
 *   2. `-NoProfile` — profile scripts are arbitrary user code; skipping them
 *      keeps the spawn deterministic. `-NonInteractive` fails loud instead
 *      of blocking on a hidden prompt. Execution policy does not apply to
 *      `-Command`, so no `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is needed.
 *   3. Zero double-quote characters in the body (`Join-Path` + single-quoted
 *      literals only). The script travels as ONE argv element through the
 *      host's spawn-time Windows argument quoting; with no `"` in the text
 *      there is nothing for that quoting layer to mangle.
 *   4. The package spec is single-quoted — a bare leading `@` is
 *      PowerShell's splatting operator.
 *   5. `.cmd` shims only, never `.ps1` — invoking a `.ps1` would re-enter
 *      execution policy.
 *   6. `exit $LASTEXITCODE` after every runtime invocation. PowerShell has
 *      no `exec`; the shell stays parent, so propagating the child's exit
 *      code preserves the Unix chain's contract. Shutdown still works:
 *      `ok mcp` exits on stdin EOF and MCP hosts kill the process tree.
 *   7. Every env-var probe is null-guarded (`if ($env:X)`) — `Join-Path` on
 *      an unset variable raises a parameter-binding error rather than
 *      returning a path.
 *   8. The PATHEXT guard on line 2 is THE load-bearing line for GUI MCP
 *      hosts. Electron hosts (Claude Desktop) spawn servers with a
 *      constructed env that omits PATHEXT; the child then inherits a
 *      registry-fallback PATHEXT of just `.CPL`. Without `.CMD` in
 *      PATHEXT, PowerShell 5.1 treats `& <path>\ok.cmd` as a SILENT
 *      NO-OP — no error record, no output, `$LASTEXITCODE` stays null —
 *      so `exit $LASTEXITCODE` became `exit 0` and the host logged only
 *      "transport closed unexpectedly". Empirically pinned on a real
 *      Windows 11 VM by env-bisection; the guard prepends the standard
 *      executable extensions and leaves a sane PATHEXT untouched.
 *   9. The `Get-Command ok.cmd` PATH probe (after the APPDATA shim probe)
 *      covers hosts that scrub APPDATA but construct a PATH that includes
 *      the npm global dir — Claude Desktop builds exactly such a PATH.
 *
 * PATH is far less hostile here than on macOS (Windows GUI apps read PATH
 * from the registry, so `Get-Command npx.cmd` usually succeeds); the
 * explicit dir probes are belt-and-braces for PATH-less setups (installer
 * default, nvm-windows via `NVM_SYMLINK`, fnm, Volta, Scoop, pnpm).
 *
 * `@latest` on the npx package spec is load-bearing for the same
 * engine-filter reason documented on `CHAIN_V2`.
 *
 * The first line `# ok-mcp-win-v1` is both a PowerShell comment and the
 * version sentinel checked by `isEntryUpToDate`. Bump the suffix (`win-v2`,
 * …) on any structurally-different chain. Same `@internal` export rules as
