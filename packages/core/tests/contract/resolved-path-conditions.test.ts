/**
 * Permanent fence for the stale-`dist/` resolution seam.
 *
 * The test runner resolves workspace packages through their `exports` map. Core
 * maps its own entry to `./src/index.ts` under the `development` condition and to
 * `./dist/index.mjs` otherwise. If that condition pin ever regresses — the classic
 * trigger is `NODE_ENV=production`, which flips the active condition to the
 * `default` (built) branch — the suite would silently run against stale build
 * output while staying green. This asserts the live source is what loads.
 *
 * Referential identity is the runner's own truth about which file backed the
 * import: one resolved file means one module-registry entry, so the package-name
 * import and the direct source import share their bindings. A flip to `dist/`
 * loads a second, distinct module and the identity breaks loud.
