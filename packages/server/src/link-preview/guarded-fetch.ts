/**
 * The single outbound-fetch chokepoint for link previews. Every remote request
 * — the page fetch, the favicon fetch, and every redirect hop — passes through
 * here so the SSRF guard cannot be bypassed.
 *
 * The transport is node:http/node:https `request()`, NOT `fetch`, because the
 * pin must behave identically on both runtimes this server runs under (Bun in
 * dev/CI, Node in the packaged desktop and the npm CLI). Bun's `fetch` accepts
 * a `tls.serverName` extension for SNI-preserving IP pins, but Node's `fetch`
 * silently ignores it, which turns the pinned HTTPS handshake into
 * SNI=IP-literal and fails certificate validation on every external target.
 * `request()` honors the same pinning options on both runtimes (verified
 * empirically on Node 22 and Bun 1.3).
 *
 * The guard is TOCTOU-safe by construction. A hostname is resolved once via
 * the injectable resolver and EVERY resolved address is validated as public
 * unicast (ip-classifier). The request then keeps the original hostname URL —
 * so SNI, certificate validation (a name mismatch rejects the fetch), and the
 * automatic `Host` header all run against the real name — while the socket is
 * pinned to the validated address through the request's `lookup` option, which
 * answers with ONLY that address. The runtime performs no second DNS lookup,
 * so there is no window in which a name could re-resolve to an internal
 * address between the check and the connect. (Both runtimes may call `lookup`
 * in the all-addresses form; the pin answers whichever form was requested.)
 * IP-literal hosts skip resolution and are classified directly (encoded forms
 * canonicalized first, and the request URL is rebuilt on the canonical literal
 * so the runtime dials it as an IP rather than resolving it as a name).
 *
 * Redirects are never auto-followed — `request()` returns the 3xx — and we
 * re-run the full scheme+resolve+validate admission on each hop's target,
 * bounded to a small hop count. Response reads are bounded on both time
 * (AbortSignal) and DECOMPRESSED size, and admit only allowlisted content
 * types. HTML reads additionally stop at head-end (`</head>` close or `<body`
 * open, scanned incrementally as decompressed bytes arrive): everything the
 * metadata extractor reads lives in the head, so the buffered prefix is
 * returned as the successful body and the rest of the page is never consumed.
 * The byte cap therefore rejects a page only when it is reached BEFORE
 * head-end — content-heavy pages whose head arrives early preview fine, while
 * bounded work is preserved (never more than the cap buffered, no reads past
 * head-end). Decompression contract: the request advertises
 * `Accept-Encoding: identity`; if a server compresses anyway, the body is
 * streamed through node:zlib (gzip/deflate/br) and the byte cap is applied to
 * the DECOMPRESSED output — the decompression-bomb guard — while unknown
 * encodings are rejected outright. No credentials ever leave: no cookie,
 * authorization, or referer header, and userinfo in the URL is dropped when
 * the request URL is rebuilt from parts (it never reaches the transport, which
 * would otherwise turn it into a basic-auth header).
 *
 * Failures return a bounded reason code and never a partial body. Reason codes
 * are the ONLY thing logged — never the hostname, resolved IP, or fetched
 * content — so local logs can't become an internal-network-topology oracle.
