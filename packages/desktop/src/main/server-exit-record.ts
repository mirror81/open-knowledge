/**
 * Records why the OpenKnowledge server process last exited, so a bug-report
 * bundle can tell an unexpected death (a crash, or an OS OOM-kill / SIGKILL)
 * apart from a managed shutdown. The desktop main process observes the child's
 * death even when the child itself could not report it (a SIGKILL leaves no
 * last words), which is exactly the case the bundle otherwise can't diagnose:
 * its liveness probe only ever reports the port "unreachable", identical for a
 * crashed server and one that was cleanly stopped.
 *
 * The record lands at `<lockDir>/last-server-exit.json` — beside `server.lock`
 * under `<projectRoot>/.ok/local/`, where the bundle collector already harvests
 * runtime state.
 *
 * Two Electron signals describe the same death and can arrive in either order:
 *   - the per-window `utilityProcess.on('exit')` handler carries the exit
 *     `code` and the pid, and knows which server it belongs to (its `lockDir`);
 *   - `app.on('child-process-gone')` carries Electron's classified `reason`
 *     (`clean-exit` / `abnormal-exit` / `killed` / `crashed` / `oom` / ...) but
 *     no pid and no lockDir.
 * This recorder joins them: whichever fires first writes the record, and the
 * later one patches in its field. Correlation is a short time window rather
 * than an identity match — the main process is single-threaded so the two
 * handlers never interleave, and a lone desktop rarely tears down two distinct
 * servers within the same window. On a wider overlap the `reason` may attach to
 * the wrong record, so it is advisory; the `code` and timing are authoritative.
