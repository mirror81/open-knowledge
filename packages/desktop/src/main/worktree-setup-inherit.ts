/**
 * Seed a freshly-created worktree's OpenKnowledge project setup from the root
 * project, so opening a worktree window doesn't re-prompt the
 * "Setup OpenKnowledge in this folder?" (Shared vs Local) consent dialog. The
 * worktree inherits the root's setup SILENTLY: the same `.ok/` scaffold and
 * editor/MCP wiring a fresh setup writes, carrying the root's `content.dir` and
 * its wired-editor set, so agents/editors work in the worktree out of the box.
 *
 * Parity is exact for a shared root whose branch committed `.ok/config.yml`:
 * that committed config lands in the worktree via checkout and is inherited
 * verbatim (the seed's `writeIfMissing` never clobbers it). For a local-only
 * root (`.ok/` uncommitted), the seed reproduces the scaffold + wiring and
 * inherits `content.dir`, but hand-edited UNCOMMITTED extras that never reach
 * the branch (e.g. a customized `.okignore`, a rarely-set `appearance.theme`)
 * are not copied — those are not part of the setup flow's output either.
 *
 * ## Why the consent dialog fires without this
 * `openProject` → `discoverProject` (`folder-admission.ts`) classifies a
 * freshly-created linked worktree via the linked-worktree carveout: an
 * UN-initialized worktree (no `<worktree>/.ok/config.yml`) returns
 * `kind:'fresh'` → the consent dialog. The gate hinges on `isProjectRoot` =
 * `<worktree>/.ok/config.yml` exists as a regular file (`OK_PROJECT_MARKER`).
 * Seeding a real, valid `config.yml` here flips the carveout off: the ancestor
 * walk then classifies the worktree `managed` (projectDir === worktree) and it
 * opens silently.
 *
 * ## What is seeded, and the writers reused (no reinvention)
 *   1. `initContent(worktree, { contentDir })` — the SAME writer the consent /
 *      create-new flows use (`@inkeep/open-knowledge-server`). Writes
 *      `.ok/config.yml` + `.ok/.gitignore` + `.okignore`. `writeIfMissing`
 *      semantics mean a config.yml already checked out by the branch (shared +
 *      committed root) is NOT clobbered. `contentDir` is read from the root's
 *      `.ok/config.yml`; it is relative to the project root, so the same value
 *      is correct in the worktree (no path rewriting).
 *   2. `writeProjectAiIntegrations(worktree, editors)` — the SAME writer the
 *      consent / create-new flows use. `editors` is the set the ROOT has wired,
 *      detected from each editor's project MCP config carrying the OK sentinel.
 *      The published MCP entries are the
 *      resilient `/bin/sh` chain — project-path-INDEPENDENT (they resolve the
 *      runtime at spawn time and derive the project from cwd), so writing them
 *      under the worktree path IS the path adaptation.
 *
 * ## Sharing mode (shared vs local-only) is inherited for free
 * `.git/info/exclude` lives in the git COMMON dir, shared across every worktree
 * of a repo. A local-only root already excluded `.ok/`, `.okignore`, the editor
 * MCP configs, etc. (unanchored/relative patterns), so those same entries cover
 * the worktree's copies: the seeded `.ok/config.yml` and editor configs are
 * ignored → they stay UNTRACKED, and `readSharingMode(worktree)` already reads
 * `local-only`. This seed performs pure file writes and never stages anything,
 * so it cannot accidentally add the worktree's `.ok/` to the index.
 *
 * Best-effort: every failure is logged, never thrown — the worktree already
 * exists on disk, and a missing seed just falls back to the normal onboarding
 * prompt (the prior behavior). Sits beside `seedWorktreeAutoSync`
 * (`worktree-autosync-inherit.ts`) and follows the same shape.
